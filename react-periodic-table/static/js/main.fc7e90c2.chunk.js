Vanadium has nuclear applications, the foil is used in cladding titanium to steel, and vanadium-gallium tape is used to produce a superconductive magnet. Originally discovered by Andres Manuel del Rio of Mexico City in 1801. His discovery went unheeded, however, and in 1820, Nils Gabriel Sefstron of Sweden rediscovered it. Metallic vanadium was isolated by Henry Enfield Roscoe in 1867. The name vanadium comes from Vanadis, a goddess of Scandinavian mythology. Silvery-white metallic transition element. Vanadium is essential to Ascidians. Rats and chickens are also known to require it. Metal powder is a fire hazard, and vanadium compounds should be considered highly toxic.

Caesium reacts explosively with cold water, and ice at temperatures above 157K. Caesium hydroxide is the strongest base known. Caesium is the most electropositive, most alkaline and has the least ionization potential of all the elements. Known uses include the basis of atomic clocks, catalyst for the hydrogenation of some organic compounds, and in photoelectric cells. Caesium was discovered by Gustav Kirchoff and Robert Bunsen in Germany in 1860 spectroscopically. Its identification was based upon the bright blue lines in its spectrum. The name comes from the latin word caesius, which means sky blue. Caesium should be considered highly toxic.

soft and malleable silvery-white metallic element, which is stable in dry air at room temperature. It oxidizes in moist air and at high temperatures. It belongs to the lanthanoids. A rare-earth metal, it is found in the minerals monazite and gadolinite. It possesses unusual magnetic properties. One natural isotope, Ho-165 exists, six radioisotopes exist, the most stable being Ho-163 with a half-life of 4570 years. Holmium is used in some metal alloys, it is also said to stimulate the metabolism. Discovered by Per Theodor Cleve and J.L. Soret in Switzerland in 1879. The name homium comes from the Greek word Holmia which means Sweden. While all holmium compounds should be considered highly toxic, initial evidence seems to indicate that they do not pose much danger. The metal\'s dust however, is a fire hazard.","dipole_polarizability":156,"dipole_polarizability_unc":10,"discoverers":"J.L.

rare-earth metal which is relatively stable in air. It happens to be the most expensive rare-earth metal. Its found with almost all rare-earth metals, but is very difficult to separate from other elements. Least abundant of all natural elements. Used in metal alloys, and as a catalyst in various processes. There are two natural, stable isotopes, and seven radioisotopes, the most stable being Lu-174 with a half-life of 3.3 years. The separation of lutetium from Ytterbium was described by Georges Urbain in 1907. It was discovered at approximately the same time by Carl Auer von Welsbach.

hard and brittle, silvery metallic transition element. It has a yellowish cast to it. Salts of iridium are highly colored. It is the most corrosion resistant metal known, not attacked by any acid, but is attacked by molten salts. There are two natural isotopes of iridium, and 4 radioisotopes, the most stable being Ir-192 with a half-life of 73.83 days. Ir-192 decays into Platinum, while the other radioisotopes decay into Osmium. Iridium is used in high temperature apparatus, electrical contacts, and as a hardening agent for platinumpy. Discovered in 1803 by Smithson Tennant in England. The name comes from the Greek word iris, which means rainbow. Iridium metal is generally non-toxic due to its relative unreactivity, but iridium compounds should be considered highly toxic.","dipole_polarizability":54,"dipole_polarizability_unc":7,"discoverers":"S.Tenant, A.F.Fourcory, L.N.Vauquelin, H.V.Collet-Descoltils","discovery_location":"England/France","discovery_year":1804,"ec":"1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 4f14 5d7 6s2 ","econf":"[Xe] 4f14 5d7 6s2","electron_affinity":1.5638,"en_allen":9.96,"en_ghosh":0.25106,"en_pauling":2.2,"evaporation_heat":604,"fusion_heat":27.61,"gas_basicity":null,"geochemical_class":"noble metal","glawe_number":62,"goldschmidt_class":"siderophile","group":{"symbol":"VIIIB","name":""},"group_id":9,"heat_of_formation":669,"is_monoisotopic":null,"is_radioactive":false,"isotopes":[{"atomic_number":77,"half_life":null,"half_life_unit":null,"is_radioactive":false,"mass_number":191,"mass_uncertainty":0.00002,"mass":190.96059,"abundance":0.373},{"atomic_number":77,"half_life":null,"half_life_unit":null,"is_radioactive":false,"mass_number":193,"mass_uncertainty":0.00002,"mass":192.96292,"abundance":0.627}],"jmol_color":"#175487","lattice_constant":3.84,"lattice_structure":"FCC","melting_point":2683,"mendeleev_number":65,"metallic_radius":127,"metallic_radius_c12":136,"molcas_gv_color":"#175487","name_origin":"Latin: iris (rainbow).","period":6,"pettifor_number":65,"proton_affinity":null,"screening_constants":[{"atomic_number":77,"n":1,"screening":1.4881000000000029},{"atomic_number":77,"n":2,"screening":4.462400000000002},{"atomic_number":77,"n":2,"screening":20.1102},{"atomic_number":77,"n":3,"screening":13.514000000000003},{"atomic_number":77,"n":3,"screening":21.9311},{"atomic_number":77,"n":3,"screening":22.794200000000004},{"atomic_number":77,"n":4,"screening":37.2628},{"atomic_number":77,"n":4,"screening":38.6552},{"atomic_number":77,"n":4,"screening":35.086},{"atomic_number":77,"n":4,"screening":34.152},{"atomic_number":77,"n":5,"screening":58.304},{"atomic_number":77,"n":5,"screening":53.339},{"atomic_number":77,"n":5,"screening":51.1545},{"atomic_number":77,"n":6,"screening":66.4334}],"sources":"Found in gravel deposits with platinum.","specific_heat":0.133,"thermal_conductivity":147,"uses":"Used with osmium to tip gold pen points, to make crucible and special containers.

greyish-white metal.

Platinum is used in jewelry, laboratory equipment, electrical contacts, dentistry, and anti-pollution devices in cars. PtCl2(NH3)2 is used to treat some forms of cancer. Platinum-Cobalt alloys have magnetic properties. It is also used in the definition of the Standard Hydrogen Electrode. Discovered by Antonio de Ulloa in South America in 1735.

Gold comes from the Anglo-Saxon word gold. Its symbol, Au, comes from the Latin word aurum, which means gold.

unreacted thallium appears silvery-white and exhibits a metallic lustre. Upon reacting with air, it begins to turn bluish-grey and looks like lead. It is very malleable, and can be cut with a knife. There are two stable isotopes, and four radioisotopes, Tl-204 being the most stable with a half-life of 3.78 years. Thallium sulphate was used as a rodenticide. Thallium sulphine\'s conductivity changes with exposure to infrared light, this gives it a use in infrared detectors. Discovered by Sir William Crookes via spectroscopy. Its name comes from the Greek word thallos, which means green twig.

It was produced by bombarding californium with boron ions. The name is temporary IUPAC nomenclature, the origin of the name comes from Ernest O. Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron.
